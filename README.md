How to Use (you can use group ids or group slugs)
You can now use the group attribute in your Events Manager shortcodes or function calls like this:
Show events from groups 1, 5, and 12: [events_list group="1,5,12"]
Show events from any group except group 7: [events_list group="-7"]
Show events from any group except groups 7, 8, and 9: [events_list group="-7,-8,-9"]
